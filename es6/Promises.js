/*
Promises have been used in JavaScript development
for a long time -- but they have always been through
third party libraries. ES6 brings a native
implementation of Promises, which will be standard
accross all browsers (hopefully!)

One thing to clarify about JavaScript code is that
it runs without pausing. There is no concept of
sleep, although there ways to defer the execution
of some lines of code.

Now let's say there is a particular line of code
that submits an HTTP request. HTTP requests don't
finish executing immediately... it takes time to
complete.

const url = "http://www.json.com"; // takes 1ms
data = makeRequest(url); // takes 3s
console.log(data); // takes 1ms

So by the time the HTTP request has finished, the
console.log(data) would have already been executed.
The question is how we can retrieve data once the
asynchronous request has finished? This is what
Promises are trying to solve. We want to delay the
console.log(data) call until after we get the result
back from the asynchronous request.

A Promise can be in one of three states; either
unresolved, resolved, or rejected. Unresolved (pending)
is the default state for a Promise. It means that a
Promise has been created and we're waiting for it to
finish. A Promise that is unresolved will eventually
be resolved or rejected.

If a Promise is resolved, it means that its process
has finished and everything went well. The callback
to handle a succesfully finished Promise is 'then.'

If a Promise has been rejected, then something has
finished, but something went wrong in the process.
The callback to handle a failed Promise is 'catch.'

One other thing to note is that Ajax requests are not
tightly coupled with the concept of Promises. So we
can have Ajax requests without Promises, and vice
versa.

/*
We create a Promise using the 'new' keyword, then
create a Promise object with a resolver function as
an argument. The resolver function takes two
arguments: resolve, and reject.
*/
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  /*
  To resolve the promise, we call the resolve()
  function, and to reject a promise, we call the
  reject() function.
  */

  /*
  When it comes to promises, it all depends on the
  browser on how long it takes for a promise to
  resolve. Let's simulate this wait time by using
  setTimeout(). If you run this code, the promise
  will be pending for around 3 seconds, and then
  the appropriate callbacks will be called.

  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve();
  }, 3000);

  For a more practical example, we have an XHTMLRequest.
  */
  var request = new XHTMLRequest();
  // make request
  request.onload = () => {
    resolve();
  }
});

/*
We register a callback like so:
*/

promise
  .then(() => console.log('finally finished!'))
  .then(() => console.log('i was also ran!!!'))
  .catch(() => console.log('an error occurred!'));

/*
So whenever the promise resolves, that function
passed in .then() will be called. We can also
chain .then() functions if we want to chain some
sequential code.

We can also have a .catch() block, and pass a
function into it. That function will get called if
the promise was rejected.
*/

/*
The most practical use of promises in ES6 is with
the fetch helper, which is now native to JavaScript
with ES6.
*/

let url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";

/*
Here's how we create an Ajax request with fetch:
*/
fetch(url)
  .then(response => console.log(response.json()))
  .then(data => console.log(data));

/*
The 'response.json()' call returns the data we
actually care about... which is an array of posts.

The 'data' object returns the following:

Response {type: "basic", url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", redirected: false, status: 200, ok: true, â€¦}
body: (...)
bodyUsed: false
headers: Headers {}
ok: true
redirected: false
status: 200
statusText: ""
type: "basic"
url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
__proto__: Response
